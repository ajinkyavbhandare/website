## Project Overview:<br>

The Custom Chatbox Application is a Python-based application powered by fastapi, integrating Langchain and the Gemini API to deliver an engaging chat experience. Through seamless integration with Google Calendar, users can interact with the application to receive personalized responses and efficiently manage their schedules.
Traditional calendar systems often prove cumbersome, requiring manual input and lacking in efficiency. To address these limitations, this project introduces an AI-driven calendar assistant aimed at enhancing productivity and simplifying calendar management. By leveraging automation and intuitive design, the assistant offers users a streamlined experience, empowering them to make the most of their time.
